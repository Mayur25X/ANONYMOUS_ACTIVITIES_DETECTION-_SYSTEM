# ANONYMOUS_ACTIVITIES_DETECTION-_SYSTEM
  Introduction : 

<em><strong>Purpose of this project</strong></em>:<br>
Malicious activity detection using real time video surveillance and in general keeping track of movements of humans begins. This project ensures to prevent the measure loss due to any unusual activities (or Malicious activity) by informing the concerned department in real time. 
The activities include violence, bad activities like gambling, drinking and carrying  dangerous weapons like Gun, Knife, etc
<br>

<em><strong>Scope of this project</strong></em>:<br>
Security services can keep track of anonymous activities and it can help in security and tracking people. 
It can be used in many places such as Parks, Malls, Parking lots, Museum, Theatre and even in college campuses. 
<br>

<em><strong>Overview </strong></em>:<br>
In this, we will be using AI, ML And DL based models with video surveillance to track any unusual activity inside the WCE Campus and within any organisation, in general keeping track of any Malicious activities.
<br>

<em><strong>General description </strong></em>:<br> Weapon Detection, fire detection, Violence and Malicious activity detection System is an AI,ML And DL based system to provide a proper security at WCE Campus and within any organization.This system will send notification to Required Department if any of the above activities are detected in the campus.This system will send notification to nearest security services to keep track on suspected person detected. The focus of this Project is application of deep learning techniques in detecting the exact count of involved persons and the activity happening in a large crowd.
