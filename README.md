# ANONYMOUS_ACTIVITIES_DETECTION-_SYSTEM
  Introduction : 

<em><strong>Purpose of this project</strong></em>:<br>
Malicious activity detection using real time video surveillance and in general keeping track of movements of humans begins. This project ensures to prevent the measure loss due to any unusual activities (or Malicious activity) by informing the concerned department in real time. 
The activities include violence, bad activities like gambling, drinking and carrying  dangerous weapons like Gun, Knife, etc
<br>

<em><strong>Scope of this project</strong></em>:<br>
Security services can keep track of anonymous activities and it can help in security and tracking people. 
It can be used in many places such as Parks, Malls, Parking lots, Museum, Theatre and even in college campuses. 
<br>

<em><strong>Overview </strong></em>:<br>
In this, we will be using AI, ML And DL based models with video surveillance to track any unusual activity inside the WCE Campus and within any organisation, in general keeping track of any Malicious activities.
<br>

<em><strong>General description </strong></em>:<br> Weapon Detection, fire detection, Violence and Malicious activity detection System is an AI,ML And DL based system to provide a proper security at WCE Campus and within any organization.This system will send notification to Required Department if any of the above activities are detected in the campus.This system will send notification to nearest security services to keep track on suspected person detected. The focus of this Project is application of deep learning techniques in detecting the exact count of involved persons and the activity happening in a large crowd.

<h1>Vision-based Fight Detection From Surveillance Cameras</h1>
<p>The system works in two parts as feature extraction and classification. The dataset contains video samples in 2 seconds long. Since the CNN is 2D the data requires some modification. So, 5-10 frames are obtained from each video sequence by considering the total frame number in the sample in a uniform manner. The frames are resized according to the input size of CNN architecture. Then, each frame is sent to CNN for feature extraction. At the end of the process we had a feature vector for each frame. After, all of the features are sent into Bi-LSTM for sequence learning. LSTM systems can learn the relationship between the current element and the previous elements. Bi-LSTM systems also can find relations between current element and the future elements so it observes the sequence in both forward and backward way. In our case, the elements were frames and the system has learnt how the frames change according to the time. So that, it can recognize the action that is occuring in the sequence. The self-attention layer improves the given input by calculating the effects of each element on the current element. Thus, it learns for each element in the sequence, which elements must be given attention the most.</p>
